            <h3>Explain Disney Charecter and Story</h3>
            <p>Walt Disney intended to build a new theme park on the East Coast that could offer the same exciting and
                compelling experience as Disneyland, which was becoming popular on the West Coast of the nation. On
                October
                1,
                1971, Walt Disney World in the vicinity of Orlando, Florida, formally opened.

                    and sister whom they call Cinderella. Her fairy godmother appears and grants Cinderella's wish to go
                    to
                    the ball, magically providing a coach, servants, a dress, and perfectly fitted glass slippers.</p>

            <p>She is the daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah. On the day of her christening, Aurora was cursed to
                die by the evil fairy Maleficent. Due to the efforts of three good fairies, the curse was altered to
                instead draw Aurora into a deep sleep that could only be broken by true love's kiss</p>
